Before Rails Israel Raphael [@fogelmania](http://www.twitter.com/fogelmania) invited me to take part in the speaker's events (thanks a lot!) - apart from being able to meet some great people that are fun to talk to (and that do a lot of stuff for open source and therefore make life better for all of us), the best part was the surfing session at the beautiful beach of Tel Aviv. A web development conference with actual surfing. Wow :)

#### [Disposable Components](http://railsisrael2013.events.co.il/presentations/852-disposable-components)

* How to write code that can become legacy code (in the sense of being used for decades)
* write tiny units/services - that are so tiny they don't need comments or (unit) tests
* never upgrade software or settings on an existing node - just replace the whole instance
* favor measurements over tests (tests as design smell)
* experience the worst case scenario as soon as possible (crash your system to learn)
